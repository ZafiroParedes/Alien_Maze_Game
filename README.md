# Alien Maze Game
This is a maze game created with C++ libraries. These libraries are used to read an input text file for a maze and then return a visual representation of the maze that changes as the player moves the alien around

The visual graphics were created using virtual studios and given [library.h]() and [library.o]() libraries to produce and modify graphics on windows.
